# Fantasy
This repo contains the code to scrape the official English Premier League stats, and the related Fantasy stats associated with. In addition, the code scrapes Understat.com, a websites that stores advanced soccer stats (such as xG) about teams and players, and merges those stats with the official ones. 

These stats are used in two ways: First, for better understanding of the English Premier Leauge (or, more generally, soccer) via data analysis and visualizations. Second, for building a machine learning model to predict players' fantasy points based on theire past performance.
