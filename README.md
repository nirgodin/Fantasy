## About
This project scrapes the official Fantasy Premier League stats, and advanced soccer stats (such as xG) about teams and players from Understat.com. In addition, it merges the data from the two sources, and uploads the data to a Heroku PostgreSQL database directly from Python.

## Motivation
This data is very valuable for better understanding of the English Premier League, the Fantasy game and most important - soccer in general.

## Some Application Examples
### *are xG stats and alike good predictors?*
